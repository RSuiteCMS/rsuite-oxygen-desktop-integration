Oxygen RSuite Client Installation Instructions

Extract the zip file under {oxygen-root}/plugins directory to install. This should create a directory named rsuite-oxygen under the plugins directory, where {oxygen-root} is the directory where Oxygen is installed (e.g., C:\Program Files\Oxygen XML Editor 15).

If the Oxygen binary is not in your search path, you will need to set the RSUITE_OXYGEN_APP environment variable to the full pathname of the oxygen executable binary.

For example:

"C:\Program Files\Oxygen XML Editor 15\oxygen.exe"

When you select "Edit with Oxygen (Desktop)" menu item in the browse tree, a dialog will come up saying the certificate of the applet cannot be verified. You will need to hit "Run" so the applet can run correctly.

The managed object will be automatically locked before Oxygen is opened.

Within Oxygen, any save operation will save the content saved back into RSuite, but it will not be checked-in.

Under Oxygen's File menu, there is an additional menu item called "RSuite - Check In". If you select this, you will be able to (permanently) check-in your changes into RSuite (this is an alternative to going to the browse tree itself an checking-in the changes you saved via the editor).

If you close the document in Oxygen (or close Oxygen itself) the check-in dialog will automatically come up asking if you want to check-in or not. You can dismiss the dialog if you already checked-in your changes.
