      Oxygen RSuite Client Installation Instructions
    </h1>
    <p>
      Extract the zip file under 
      <code>
        {
        <i>
          oxygen-root
        </i>
        }/plugins
      </code>
      directory to install. This should create a directory named 
      <code>
        rsuite-oxygen
      </code>
      under the 
      <code>
        plugins
      </code>
      directory, where 
      <i>
        {
        <i>
          oxygen-root
        </i>
        }
      </i>
      is the directory where Oxygen is installed (e.g., 
      <code>
        C:\Program Files\Oxygen XML Editor 15
      </code>
      ).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Oxygen binary is not in your search path, you will need to set the RSUITE_OXYGEN_APP environment variable to the full pathname of the oxygen executable binary. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: 
    </p>
    <code>
      "C:\Program Files\Oxygen XML Editor 15\oxygen15.2.exe" 
    </code>
    <p>
      When you select "Edit with Oxygen (Desktop)" menu item in the browse tree, a dialog will come up saying the certificate of the applet cannot be verified. You will need to hit "Run" so the applet can run correctly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The managed object will be automatically locked before Oxygen is opened. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Within Oxygen, any save operation will save the content saved back into RSuite, but it will not be checked-in. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Under Oxygen's File menu, there is an additional menu item called "RSuite - Check In". If you select this, you will be able to (permanently) check-in your changes into RSuite (this is an alternative to going to the browse tree itself an checking-in the changes you saved via the editor). 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you close the document in Oxygen (or close Oxygen itself) the check-in dialog will automatically come up asking if you want to check-in or not. You can dismiss the dialog if you already checked-in your changes.
